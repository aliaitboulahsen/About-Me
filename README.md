# Ali Ait's Bio

Digital Performance Manager with a deep expertise in the banking industry. I drive digitalization strategies and product roadmaps through cross-functional collaborations, external partnerships and agile methodologies.

In a crossroad of Fintech and Operations, I currently lead the integration of a FinTech ecosystem within the traditional banking system with an end to end credit card transformation and product enhancement. 

Exploring my various interests, specifically around artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies, has landed me into pursuing a Bootcamp Certificate in Fintech at the University of Toronto. I had the opportunity to collaborate with experts in the industry, driving and developing real-life projects using Python, Solidity and different Machine Learning Models.
 
Striving for high impact in all areas of business, I have developed a track record of accomplishments and high performance managing different teams in the Operations and Strategy department at Laurentian Bank and John Paul by developing a culture of teamwork, innovation and problem solving.
